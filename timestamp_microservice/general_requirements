### SHORT

1 - a simple presentable interface web service

2 - with fields to receive time data

3 - one in a date format, the other in unix format

4 - both return a json with time in unix and in utc


### BIGGER

1 - basics of Vue.JS to cover the "presentable" part here and for future projects

2 - the fields will be provided in forms, learn it in vue docs

3 - date will be a dropdown, unix format will be given in a simple text box

4 - ...
	4.1.start the express server with json body-parser - the server will use a controller module
	
	4.2.a choice must be made: make different url for unix and date formats or to make a way that the only controller function distinguish the entry format - the return is the same for both, so probably is best to make a single function the makes the checking
	
	4.3.depending on the format, the value will be parsed and send in json in response
	
	4.4.make checkings on invalid formats, invalid dates (future days), just a try/except
